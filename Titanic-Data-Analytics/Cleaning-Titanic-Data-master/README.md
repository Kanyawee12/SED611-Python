# Cleaning-Titanic-Data
##About the data
 One of the most popular starter data sets in data science, the Titanic data set. This is a data set that records various attributes of passengers on the Titanic, including who survived and who didnâ€™t. 
##What did I do
 Here I have detected some missing value, replace the missing values and also create new values added to the dataset. 
 ![rplot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14057932/15985130/22c7cf80-2fa9-11e6-8c4e-8f0cd123dfda.png)
                       
                        here is the overview of the missing value in the original dataset.
##The output
 There are two csv files, first one is titanic_original.csv and second one is tatanic_clean.csv. Second csv is generated from the R code, called 'titanic.r' here. Have fun.
